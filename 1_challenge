As intelligent and inquisitive creatures we should never be satisfied 
with our assumptions. We should remain open to the fact that any 
conclusion we may have come to should be held up to scrutiny and always 
open to challenge. Even the assumptions that make up the foundation of 
our reality should be challenged constantly. One should remain open to 
changing one's view about the world if it can be proven, scientifically, 
that our assumptions about the world and reality are incorrect.
