There are 2 modes of seeing reality

1. An entity based mode 
2. An experience based mode

In an entity based mode objects and entities exist. We see things as 
existing on their own even when we are not experiencing them.

In an experienced based mode only moments of experiences exist. These 
experiences are categorized in 1 of 6 types. An experience of hearing, 
seeing, smelling, tasting, feeling, or thinking. In this mode there are 
no objects or entities; only moments of experience.

The entity based mode relies on experience to prove itself. One cannot 
prove the existance of an object or entity withouth first using 
experience. Therefore, we say that experience is at the forefront or the 
root of everything we know.

In a world where entities are the reality there is a lot of suffering to 
be found. Objects maintain their permanence and their self identity. 
Both of these things are causes for huge amounts of suffering. If the 
permanence of something we hold dear is ever threatened we suffer.

In a world where experience is the reality then we see clearly how 
everything is impermanent, cannot give us lasting satisfaction, and has 
no self identity.

Both modes of seeing reality are useful at different times. An entity 
based mode allows for the development and advancement of science and 
humanity as a whole. But at what cost? In a world where we are driven by 
our desires permanence is key. But this very chasing of our desires is 
why we suffer in the first place.
