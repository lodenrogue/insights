Through my observations I've come to the conslusion that the sense of 
self arises through the interaction of mental formations and physical 
sensations. More specifically, a vague mental image resembling one's 
face, an emotion that resonates in the chest and stomach area, and a 
pressure somewhere near the top of the head or behind the eyes.

When each of these experiences is observed independently or in rotation 
the sense of self dissapears. Just like when the parts of a chariot are 
inspected indiviually one realizes what is called a chariot is merely a 
collection of parts.

In reality there are 4 categorical experiences present when a sense of 
self arises. A mental image, an emotional feeling, a physical sensation, 
and, as a result, a perception of self.
